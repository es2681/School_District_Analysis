# Stock Analysis with VBA
## Overview of Project
Steve just graduated from college with a degree in finance. His parents are interested in investing in green energy and have asked Steve for help.  Specifically, Steve's parents are interested in investing with DAQO New Energy Corporation. DAQO New Energy Corporation makes silicon wafers used in solar panels and trades on the stock market as "DQ".  For this project, we analyzed DQ stock prices as well as the prices for ten additional publicly traded companies in 2017 and 2018 using the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) add-on in Excel to recommend whether DQ stock is a wise investment.
## Results
We analyzed the returns on DQ and ten other stocks (AY; CSIQ; ENPH; FSLR; HASI; JKS; RUN; SEDG; SPWR; TERP; and VSLR) for 2017 and 2018 using VBA in Microsoft Excel. 
In 2017, the return on investment for DQ stock was 199.4%. All other stocks also had positive returns, with the exception of TERP with a return of -7.2%. Of the 11 stocks analyzed, DQ had the highest return rate for this year.
In 2018, the return on investment rate for DQ was -62.6%. All other stocks, with the except of ENPH and RUN, also had negative returns in 2018. Of the 11 stocks analyzed, DQ had the lowest return rate for this year.
